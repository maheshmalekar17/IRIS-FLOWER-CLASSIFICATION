# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION

This project employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify iris flower species using the well-known Iris dataset. The dataset comprises 150 samples with features including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. After visualizing the data with pairplots, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets. An SVM model with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel is then trained and evaluated using K-Fold cross-validation. The model achieved an accuracy of 96.66%, effectively classifying the iris species.
